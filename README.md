# Course Work

## Description

This repository is all the work I had to do in and outside the classroom to complete a computer science degree at NAU (Northern Arizona University). All code here is mostly for learning and review of lessons learned. None of this code is maintained so if you are here to copy and paste, you will surely be disappointed.

By all means, use this project as guidance on your course work, but none of it should be treated as the most efficient way to solve the problems they intended to solve.

- Computer Science II (Python 2 and 3)
